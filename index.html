    <h2>Scope and Motivation</h2>
    <p>To motivate the development of WebRTC 1.0, the IETF RTCWEB WG developed [[RFC7478]].
    This document describes use cases motivating the development of
    "WebRTC Next Version" (WebRTC-NV), and the requirements deriving from those use cases.
    The use cases fall into one of two categories:
    enhancements to use cases already covered in [[RFC7478]], and
    new use cases currently not implementable in WebRTC 1.0.</p>

      <p>The uses cases in this section improve upon use cases described in [[RFC7478]].</p>
   <section id="multipartygame*">
      <h3>Multiparty online game with voice communications</h3>
      <p>[[RFC7478]] Section 2.3.12 describes a use case involving a multiparty online game with voice communications.
      In these scenarios, reducing time to join the game and receive media is important. To minimize this,
      ICE enhancements are desirable, such as
      the ability to control candidate gathering and pruning.  Also, “parallel forking” minimizes conference
      establishment time by allowing a participant to broadcast an Offer to a “room” abstraction (maintained on a
      server), with other room participants responding back directly to the Offerer, avoiding a separate discovery step.
      It is desirable to allow media to be received from responders before the initiator receives an answer.
      Also, the ability to impose a bandwidth limit across all mesh endpoints limits the build up of queues that can
      affect audio quality or perceived latency in the game. Supporting this enhancement adds the following requirements:</p>

   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   N01             The user agent can control candidate gathering
                   and pruning, limiting the networks on which
                   candidates are gathered, the types of candidates,
                   etc.
   N02             The user agent must be able to support parallel
                   forking, including reuse of local ICE candidates

      <h3>Video Conferencing with a Central Server</h3>
      <p>[[RFC7478]] Section 2.4.3.1 describes a use case involving Multiparty Video Communications with
      a central conferencing server. In such a use case, clients with disparate capabilities such as
      differing bandwidth availability,
      screen size and maximum displayable frame rate may participate in the same conference.
      In such a situation it is advantageous to support Scalable Video Coding (SVC).
      Encoding with temporal scalability is supported by several browsers today and is utilized by most
      centralized conferencing services.</p>
      <p>It is expected that spatial scalability (supported by VP9 and AV1) will become more popular with time.
      In this use case, if the desired video codec is known beforehand and participants are muted by default
      (as in a very large meeting), it is desirable to allow new participants to start receiving immediately,
      without negotiation. Supporting this enhancement adds the following requirements:</p>
<pre class="highlight">

                   video utilizing temporal scalability and (if
                   supported by the chosen codec) spatial scalability.
   N08             A user agent can receive audio/video without a
                   corresponding sender.
   N09             It is possible to select the sending and/or
                   receiving codec without negotiation.
   N10             The user agent must be able to control
                   robustness (RTX, RED, FEC) applied to individual 
                   simulcast and SVC layers.

<p>This use case has been implemented by conferencing services utilizing [[ORTC]],
as well as proprietary additions to [[WEBRTC10]].</p>

                   that does not compete aggressively with
                   audio/video communications.
   N14             It must be possible for the file exchange to
                   be supported by servers as well as user agents.

<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>In a web game called “NameTheBird.com” participants use their devices to provide audio and video observations of
birds to the service along with identifications for training purposes, allowing the service to identify birds from
the provided audio and video and returning this information to the users in real-time.</p>
<p>The web application has a site specific federated learning-based classifier for contextual object detection,
user intent prediction and media manipulation, allowing it to augment the streams it receives and inject identifying
or other supplemental information into the streams sent or received.</p>
<p>The shared classification models are trained on the birds found by the participants and are based on the feedback
of the participants. Each device client updates of the model are up-streamed to a shared model server that pushes
updates of the global model to the clients.</p>
<p>Implementation outline:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Originating media (raw) streams are cloned for inference and training purposes, denoted “inference stream” and
  “training stream”, with the inference stream also being the media stream shared with peer(s). The cloning can occur
  any time during a session.</li>
  <li>Inference stream: A web site specific classifier acts on the raw inference stream, with the result used to
  guide a custom encoder in the sender device and send metadata to the server and peer devices outside the media stream.
  The encoder adds proper augmentation, e.g. sign with “name this bird” hovering over the enlarged bird in case of video
  enrichment, or enhanced bird song if audio.</li>
  <li>Training stream: Model in training classifies the raw data and evaluate the classification using user feedback,
  said feedback loop being web site specific. The evaluation may be  “online” or “offline”, offline meaning the training
  is done at a later stage on the recorded encoded media set.</li>
  <li>Both inference stream and training streams may use payload protection depending on trust model on compute
  resources for optional intermedia server side of app.</li>
  <li>Both inference stream and training streams use transport object for communicating with peers or servers,
  the communication in some cases can be a site specific QUIC based transport solution, in others RTP based.</li>

<h3>Don't Pown My Video Conferenciong </h3>
<p>
  Cloud video conferencing system such as WebEx, Hangouts, and Zoom,
  have no need to be able to see all the content of the media flowing
  over there servers. Some of them explicitly desire to to be able to
  promote trust by explicitly showing they do not have access to the
  audio and video contents of the their users calls. They are trused
  to connect the right peoiple to the confernce and route the packets
  but they are not trusted to see the contents of the audio and vidoe
  media in the call.
</p>
<p>
  Solutions to problenm fall into two major catagores: ones where the
  JS it trusted, one ones where it is not:
</p>
<h4>Untrusted JS Cloud Conferncing</h4>
<p>
  There are many cases wehere a system such as WebEx is trusted to
  connect the members of a confernce but has no need to acces the
  audio or video contents of the conferece. This is truye of the
  majorit of audio vidoe ocnferncing sytems on the web today. Juzt so
  you understand the scope of this requiment, there are more mintues
  of WebRTC that are usined in confernces wher the the media server
  has no need of access to the media than any other use of WebRTC my
  orders of magnitude. This is the pramry use case for WebRTC at this
  point in time and accounts for billions of minute per month of use
  of WebRTC. There is no other use case that comes remotely close to
  this use case. </p>
<p>
  In this use case, the JS comes from the operater of the confernce
  brige. The WebRTC use the isolated media features of WebRTC to keep
  the JS from accessing the meqdia and the identity featuers to
  provide a user interface that allows the user to know it connected
  to the correct confernces. The goal is for the end users to be able
  see the audio and video media contetns, but the web serverice that
  provides the JS and the media switching bridges and SFUs can not see
  the media. Some meta data about the conferce, such as the power
  levels of the audio media, are encrypt to the SFU. 
</p>
<p> A possible solution this probelm is the the browser to negotiatte
  end to end encrytpions keys using aproach such as the IETF PERC
  work. The end to end keys are not reveleared to the JS.
</p>
<h4>Trusted JS</h4>
<p>
  In some highly controlled situtaiton such as department of defence,
  the JS can come from a trusted source while the SFU the distributes
  the packets is not trusted to see the contents of the confernce. the
  SFU is trusted to forward packets aproeropare and not DOS the the
  conferences. </p>
<p>
  In this case the JS runing the WebRTC applicaitons comes from a
  trusted soruce and is allowed to access to the contents of the
  media. These use cases tend to be relativelyu small deplyments as
  they require the JS to come from a trusted source but still tyring
  to use a media server from an untrused soruce. The media needs to be
  ecnrypted with keys that are not known to the opeerator of media
  server, then sent to the media server which deal with
  conferencing. It is accpetaed able for the power levels of the audio
  content to be revealed to the media server even though this reveals
  some information about the content.
